# Adapter Pattern

Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.  
Adapter wraps one of the objects to hide the complexity of conversion happening behind the scenes.  
Ideally the client side (usage side) object is wrapped inside the adapter / is implemented by the adapter.  
2-way adapters are possible as well.  
Adapters are Translators
